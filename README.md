# To Do List - DOM manipulation example
Front-End Vanilla JavaScript sample of DOM manipulation. It consists of a "to-do list" where users can do the following:
- Create, modify, and delete tasks.
- Drag and drop tasks from the "to do" state to the "ongoing" and "done" states, also back and forth.

The original implementation of modals has been kept, but should be replaced by an HTML `<dialog>`.
